# Flutter Simple Multi Display and Windows Managment

Introduction

Welcome to Simple Multi Display, a streamlined solution I've developed for managing multiple windows and passing information between the main and secondary windows in a Flutter application. This project aims to simplify the often complex task of window management, providing an intuitive and efficient way to handle multiple display scenarios. The basic idea is to have a main window that “controls” and sends information to other secondary windows, perhaps arranged on different monitors/displays (hence the name).

Given the lack of official material on this topic, I thought of a solution to simplify the management of multiple windows in Flutter applications.

Features

Multi-window Management: Seamlessly open and control multiple windows within a single application.
Data Exchange: Easily pass information between the main window and secondary windows, ensuring smooth communication and data consistency.
An Example with an User-friendly Interface: Designed to be intuitive and easy to use, even for those new to multi-window management in Flutter.

Credits

I would like to extend my gratitude to the creators of the desktop_multi_window package (https://pub.dev/packages/desktop_multi_window), which has been instrumental in the development of Simple Multi Display. You can learn more about this package and its capabilities in his repository.

Background

The development of Simple Multi Display was inspired by the anticipation and subsequent discontinuation of multi-window support in Flutter. The need for a solution became evident in a Flutter orienterd project, which highlighted both the potential and the challenges of implementing such functionality. Despite the official discontinuation of multi-window development in Flutter, Simple Multi Display steps in to partially fill this gap.

System Compatibility

Please note that Simple Multi Display has been tested exclusively on the Windows operating system. 

Conclusion

Simple Multi Display offers a practical and efficient solution for managing multiple windows in a Flutter application. It is poised to be a valuable tool for developers looking to enhance their applications with multi-window functionality.


Thank you for your interest in Simple Multi Display. I look forward to your feedback and hope this project proves to be beneficial in your Flutter development endeavors.
